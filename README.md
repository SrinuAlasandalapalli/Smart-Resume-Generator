Scenario 1: University Career Services A university's career services department offers a resume generator to assist students in creating polished resumes tailored to specific industries. Students input details such as their academic achievements, internships, and extracurricular activities, and the tool generates resumes highlighting the most relevant skills and experiences for fields like finance, engineering, or marketing. This service helps students stand out in competitive job markets, similar to how career advisors provide tailored guidance based on individual career goals.

Scenario 2: Job Placement Agencies A job placement agency uses the resume generator to streamline the job application process for clients. Candidates provide their work history, skills, and job preferences, and the tool produces multiple resume versions optimized for different job roles. This ensures that clients can quickly apply to various positions with resumes tailored to each opportunity, enhancing their chances of securing interviews. The approach is akin to personalized job coaching, where advisors help candidates, craft resumes for specific roles.

Scenario 3: Freelancers and Gig Workers Freelancers and gig workers use the resume generator to create dynamic resumes that reflect their diverse project experience and skill sets. By inputting details of past projects, skills, and client testimonials, the tool generates resumes suited for different types of gigs, such as web development, graphic design, or writing. This allows freelancers to quickly customize their resumes when bidding for new projects, similar to how they might adjust their portfolios to match the needs of potential clients.

Project Flow 1)User Input via Streamlit UI: Users input a prompt (e.g., topic, keywords) and specify parameters such as the desired length, tone, or style through the Streamlit interface. 2)Backend Processing with Generative AI Model: The input data is sent to the backend, where it interfaces with the selected Generative AI model (e.g., GPT-4, Gemini, etc.). The model processes the input, generating text based on the specified parameters and user input. 3)Content Generation: The AI model autonomously creates content tailored to the user’s specifications. This could be a blog post, poem, article, or any other form of text. 4)Return and Display Generated Content: The generated content is sent back to the frontend for display on the Streamlit app. The app presents the content to the user in an easily readable format. 5)Customization and Finalization: Users can further customize the generated content through the Streamlit UI if desired. This might include editing text, adjusting length, or altering tone. 6)Export and Usage: Once satisfied, users can export or copy the content for their use, such as saving it to a file or directly sharing it.
